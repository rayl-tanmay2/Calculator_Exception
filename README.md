## Project Structure

```
CalculatorApp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MainCalculator.java       // Main driver with menu
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Addition.java             // Handles addition logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Subtraction.java          // Handles subtraction logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Multiplication.java       // Handles multiplication logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Division.java             // Handles division logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Square.java               // Handles square logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cube.java                 // Handles cube logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SquareRoot.java           // Handles square root logic
```

Each operation is encapsulated in a separate class, maintaining clean and maintainable code.

## üõ°Ô∏è Exception Handling

The application uses built-in exception handling for a smooth user experience:

| Exception                | Handled Scenario                           |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `InputMismatchException` | When user enters non-numeric input         |
| `ArithmeticException`    | Division by zero or square root of negative|
| `Exception`              | Any other unexpected error                 |

##  Coding Standards Followed

- Clean class/method names (`CamelCase`)
- Modular structure (one class per operation)
- In-code comments for clarity
- Proper indentation and formatting
- Descriptive variable names

##  Future Enhancements

- GUI version using JavaFX or Swing  
- History of previous calculations  
- Scientific calculator functions (log, sin, cos)  
- Unit testing with JUnit
